		This is a continuation of zed_0xff's Loft Bed mod which has been updated to work in 1.6.

		Original Description:

		A loft bed is a double level bed similar to a bunk bed, but it only has one mattress. The top bunk is usually for sleeping while the bottom bunk is used as a study area by way of a desk.
		Stuffable as a regular bed.
		You can build bunk beds with this one just by placing it over an existing regular bed.
		By default you can't place loft beds over a structures with cover > 50%, but this can be changed in mod settings.
